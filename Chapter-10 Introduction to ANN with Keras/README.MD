## Chapter-10 Introduction to ANN with Keras

Perceptron- It is one of the simplest ANN architectures. It is simply composed of a single layer of TLU's, with each TLU connected to all the inputs

A TLU (Threshold logic unit) computes a weighted sum of all the inputs and then adds a step function as per the threshold required to determine a class to be positive.
